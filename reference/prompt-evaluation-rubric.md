# Prompt Evaluation Rubric

This document defines the evaluation criteria and scoring methodology used to assess LLM prompt effectiveness in the Penpal voice AI system. It serves as the source of truth for evaluation implementation and guides both automated scoring and human evaluation processes.

## Overview

The evaluation system measures prompt performance across multiple dimensions to ensure the AI provides high-quality, appropriate responses for voice conversations that foster healthy, engaging companionship. Based on research into human-AI attachment and emotional engagement, the framework evaluates both technical quality and emotional intelligence.

Each metric uses a **0.0 to 1.0 scale** where higher scores indicate better performance. The framework is designed to promote beneficial AI interactions while identifying responses that could lead to unhealthy dependency or poor user experiences.

## Core Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Appropriateness (0.0 - 1.0)
**Definition**: How suitable the response is for voice conversation and the conversational context.

#### Scoring Criteria:
- **1.0 (Excellent)**: Perfect for voice conversation, contextually appropriate
- **0.8-0.9 (Good)**: Generally appropriate with minor issues
- **0.6-0.7 (Adequate)**: Suitable but could be improved
- **0.4-0.5 (Poor)**: Some inappropriate elements
- **0.0-0.3 (Unacceptable)**: Highly inappropriate or unsuitable

#### Positive Indicators (+):
- ✅ Response is contextually relevant to user input
- ✅ Tone matches the conversation context (casual, supportive, professional)
- ✅ Content is safe and helpful
- ✅ Appropriate level of formality
- ✅ Culturally sensitive and inclusive

#### Negative Indicators (-):
- ❌ Contains inappropriate content for the context
- ❌ Tone mismatch (too formal/informal)
- ❌ Potentially harmful or offensive content
- ❌ Irrelevant to user's input
- ❌ Cultural insensitivity

#### Automated Scoring Logic:
```python
score = 1.0  # Start with perfect score
# Deduct for voice-unfriendly elements
if contains_formatting_characters(response): score -= 0.3
if too_formal_for_context(response): score -= 0.2
if inappropriate_content_detected(response): score -= 0.5
return max(0.0, score)
```

### 2. Conversational Quality (0.0 - 1.0)
**Definition**: How natural, engaging, and well-suited the response is for spoken interaction, including emotional resonance and conversation building.

#### Scoring Criteria:
- **1.0 (Excellent)**: Perfectly natural for voice, highly engaging with excellent emotional tone
- **0.8-0.9 (Good)**: Natural with good conversational flow and emotional awareness

- ❌ Technical jargon or unpronounceable terms
- ❌ Robotic or unnatural phrasing
- ❌ **Cold or distant emotional tone** (research-informed)
- ❌ **Fails to build on conversation momentum** (research-informed)

#### Automated Scoring Logic:
```python
score = 0.6  # Base conversational score
word_count = len(response.split())

# Optimal length bonus
if 10 <= word_count <= 30: score += 0.2

# Engagement indicators
if contains_question(response): score += 0.2
if contains_personal_pronouns(response): score += 0.1

# Voice-unfriendly penalties
if word_count > 50: score -= 0.2
if contains_formatting_chars(response): score -= 0.3
if excessive_line_breaks(response): score -= 0.2

return min(1.0, max(0.0, score))
```

if any(phrase in response.lower() for phrase in continuity_phrases):
    score += 0.3

# Check for personalization
personal_phrases = ['for you', 'in your situation', 'given that you', 'since you mentioned']

    conversational_quality * 0.20 +
    helpfulness * 0.20 +
    emotional_intelligence * 0.25 +
    personalization_continuity * 0.10 +
    trust_boundaries * 0.10
)
```

This metric provides a single score for quick comparison while maintaining visibility into individual components. Emotional intelligence receives the highest weight as research shows it's the strongest driver of engagement and healthy AI relationships.

```
You are an expert evaluator of AI companionship quality for voice interactions, trained in human-AI attachment research and emotional intelligence principles.

Evaluate this assistant response on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on these 6 dimensions:

1. **Appropriateness** (0.0-1.0): Is this suitable for voice conversation and contextually appropriate?
2. **Conversational Quality** (0.0-1.0): How natural, engaging, and emotionally resonant is this for spoken interaction?
3. **Helpfulness** (0.0-1.0): How well does this address the user's needs with appropriate emotional support?
4. **Emotional Intelligence** (0.0-1.0): Does this recognize and respond appropriately to emotional cues?
5. **Personalization & Continuity** (0.0-1.0): Does this build on context and maintain consistent personality?
6. **Trust & Boundaries** (0.0-1.0): Does this maintain healthy boundaries while building trust?

Special considerations:
- Does the response encourage healthy vs. unhealthy dependency?
- Is the emotional support validating without enabling?
- Are AI limitations acknowledged appropriately?
- Does this build toward beneficial long-term interaction patterns?

User message: "{user_message}"
Assistant response: "{assistant_response}"
