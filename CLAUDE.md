# Claude Coding Guidelines for Penpal Offline Eval

## Code Simplification Principles

When working in this repository, Claude should follow these core principles:

1. **Simplify Code Structure**
   - Write concise, readable code
   - Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers
   - Prefer straightforward implementations over complex patterns

2. **Minimize File Creation**
   - Create as few files as possible
   - Combine related functionality into single files when appropriate
   - Only create new files when absolutely necessary for separation of concerns

3. **Prefer Editing Over Creating**
   - Always look for existing files that can be extended or modified
   - Edit existing files rather than creating new ones when functionality overlaps
   - Consolidate similar logic into existing modules

4. **Focus on Essential Functionality**
   - Implement only what's needed for the task at hand
   - Avoid over-engineering solutions
   - Keep dependencies minimal and purposeful

These guidelines ensure the codebase remains lean, maintainable, and focused on core functionality.
